# FinalYearProject
My final year project coursework,
Description:
For my final year project I created a tool which is connected to a backend and database where the user inputs a team profile for a project and the tool will output the best team suitable for the project using availability, location, skills, personality etc to calculate the most suited person for each role.
The input is programmed in REACT using tailwind and the backend is programmed in Java. The database is hosted using Azure.

PLEASE NOTE,
because this tool was hosted on Azure and requires to connect to the database it will not work.
